# "SageMaker 100": Getting Started with Amazon SageMaker

In this workshop, we'll start to explore [Amazon SageMaker](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/) with a focus on data preparation and AutoML features including [Autopilot](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/autopilot/), [Data Wrangler](https://aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/data-wrangler/), the [Built-In Algorithms](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/algos.html), and [Automatic Hyperparameter Tuning](https://docs.aws.amazon.com/sagemaker/latest/dg/automatic-model-tuning.html)

We'll review a tabular data classification use case: First applying SageMaker Autopilot to the raw dataset, and then experimenting with manual feature engineering and model tuning to see if you can achieve higher accuracy than Autopilot!
